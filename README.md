# Simulation of 2D Computational Geometry problems
_This Repository contains the [solutions](https://github.com/ShubhamPriyadarshi/CompGeoSim/tree/master/ConsolePrograms) along with a [WebGL Simulation](https://shubhampriyadarshi.github.io/WebGL/CompGeoSim/) of the challenges for [CCTech's hiring activity for June 2020](https://github.com/cctech-labs/challenges/blob/master/2020/06/hiring/software_developer.md)_

## Console based programs 
### The Console based C# programs for the challenges can be found [here](https://github.com/ShubhamPriyadarshi/CCTech-Hiring-Challenge-June-2020/tree/master/ConsolePrograms).
-   #### Problem 1 : Check if the given point lies inside or outside a polygon.
    **Description**: Given a polygon and a point 'p', find if 'p' lies inside the polygon or not. The points lying on the border are considered inside.
  
    The C# Program for the above problem can be found [here](https://github.com/ShubhamPriyadarshi/CompGeoSim/blob/master/ConsolePrograms/Challenge%201%20-%20Point%20in%20Polygon.cs)
    
-   #### Problem 2 :  Calculate the surface of the building exposed to sunlight.
    **Description**: Given a coordinates of buildings and source point 'p' of sunlight. Calculate the length of building exposed to sunlight having the source at point.
    
    The C# Program for the above problem can be found [here](https://github.com/ShubhamPriyadarshi/CompGeoSim/blob/master/ConsolePrograms/Challenge%202%20-%20Sunlight%20Building.cs)
    
-   #### Problem 3 :  Calculate the coordinates of the chord of a circle.
    **Description**: Given the coordinates of the centre and radius of a circle, length of a line segment, clearance and angle of the perpendicular bisector of the line segment, find the coordinates of the chord of the circle formed located at the point of intersection between the lines perpendicular to the the line segment (originating from the ends of the line segment) and the circle.
